# Nutrition-App!
Nutrition-App is a mobile application developed in [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). The idea of this app is to help people to getting into the habit of eating health food. This is accomplished by providing people a platform to order meals that are both low-cost to order and time efficient to prepare.

# Setup
To run this app, you need to include a private **config.js** file (which is currently not given to anyone outside of our team).
After you have the **config.js** file, direct to your project folder and run **yarn install**. This will take a bit of time to run but once all the dependencies are installed you can then run **expo start**.
